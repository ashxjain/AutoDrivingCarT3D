# AutoDrivingCarT3D
Simple auto driving car using T3D Reinforcement learning

# How to run
* Because of unavailability of GPU on my desktop, i have trained it on Google Colab. But running Kivy on colab is very complex, hence once training is done on Colab, model is downloaded to pytorch_models directory and then it is run on my local desktop.
* Use `AutoDrivingCarT3D.ipynb` to train on Colab
* For inference, run: `python carkv.py`
